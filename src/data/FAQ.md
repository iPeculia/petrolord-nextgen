# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

**Q: Is this real data?**  
A: No. The data is synthetically generated based on characteristic type curves from the Permian Basin (Wolfcamp/Bone Spring). It mimics real behavior but does not represent any specific real-world lease.

**Q: Can I use this for actual decision making?**  
A: No. This dataset is for demonstration and training purposes only.

**Q: Is the data saved to the database?**  
A: By default, the sample data is loaded into your browser's local memory. It is only saved to the database if you explicitly use the "Save Project" feature.

## Features

**Q: Why are some wells shut-in?**  
A: We included shut-in wells (e.g., PB-006) to demonstrate the anomaly detection algorithms.

**Q: Can I mix sample data with my own data?**  
A: Yes. Once the sample project is loaded, you can use the **Import** tool to add your own CSV files to the existing project list.

**Q: What economic parameters are used?**  
A: The Base Case uses $75/bbl Oil and $3.50/mcf Gas. You can view full details in the Scenarios tab.

**Q: How do I export this data?**  
A: Go to the **Export** tab to download the production history or analysis parameters as CSV/Excel.

# Quick Start Guide: Material Balance Sample Data

Follow these steps to immediately start exploring the Material Balance Analysis module using our Permian Basin sample dataset.

## 1. Load the Data
1.  Navigate to the **Material Balance** module.
2.  On the "Welcome" screen, click the **Load Sample Data** button.
3.  Wait for the "Sample Data Loaded" confirmation message.

## 2. Explore the Dashboard
1.  Click the **Dashboard** tab in the top navigation bar.
2.  View high-level statistics about the loaded reservoirs, including total active wells and reservoir types.
3.  Review the "Reservoir Types" chart to see the breakdown of Oil vs. Condensate assets.

## 3. View Production History
1.  Click the **Data & Tanks** tab.
2.  Select the **Production & Pressure History** sub-tab.
3.  View the Oil, Gas, and Water rate plots.
4.  **Tip**: Use the zoom tools on the chart to inspect specific periods of production.

## 4. Analyze Rock Properties
1.  Click the **Rock Props** tab.
2.  Observe the **Relative Permeability** curves ($k_{rw}$ vs. $k_{row}$).
3.  These curves represent the flow characteristics of the rock-fluid system for the selected reservoir.

## 5. Manage Wells
1.  Click the **Wells** tab.
2.  Review the list of individual wells associated with the current reservoir.
3.  Check the status (Active vs. Shut-in) and cumulative production for each well.

## 6. View Groups
1.  Click the **Groups** tab.
2.  See how the 5 reservoirs have been categorized into "Midland Basin" and "Delaware Basin" groups.

## 7. Switch Reservoirs
1.  Locate the **Reservoir List** in the Left Sidebar.
2.  Click on a different reservoir (e.g., "Delaware Bone Spring") to switch the active view.
3.  All tabs (Plots, Wells, PVT) will instantly update to show data for the newly selected reservoir.

## 8. Clear Data
1.  To start fresh or create your own project, you can clear the sample data.
2.  (Note: Feature implementation varies; typically found in Project Settings or by creating a New Project).
